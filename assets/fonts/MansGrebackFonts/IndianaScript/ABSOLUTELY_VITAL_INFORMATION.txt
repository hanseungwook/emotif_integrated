In a classic logotype style, Indiana Script is a sharp and steady typeface created by Måns Grebäck.

It contains ligatures and alternate characters, and supports a very wide range of languages. 

Write _ after a word to get a swash. 
Example: Indiana_

With ligatures activated, write _ and a number for more swashes.
